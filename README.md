# image caption generator
## Image caption generator is a process of recognizing the context of an image and annotating it with relevant captions using deep learning, and computer vision.  
### we will use two deep learning architechture [CNN](https://towardsdatascience.com/convolutional-neural-networks-explained-9cc5188c4939) and [LSTM](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/03/introduction-to-long-short-term-memory-lstm/) for this project to generate caption for given images. 
## Requirements
- string
- numpy
- [PIL](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- os
- [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html)
- matplotlib
- [keras](https://keras.io/)
- [tqdm](https://tqdm.github.io/)
## we are also using pretrained model [xception](https://keras.io/api/applications/xception/) for this project  
### please refer to notebook for detailed project
